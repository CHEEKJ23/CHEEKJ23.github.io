                <strong> Gordon Ramsay – How to Cook a Perfect Steak</strong>
              <p>Gordon Says “don’t forget to cook a steak around the big night. If you follow these simple rules, it’s going to be easy. Let the pan get nice and hot. If there’s no heat inside the pan, there’s no color. If there’s no color, there’s no flavor”. Make sure the steak is relaxed, meaning it’s at room temperature. A relaxed steak will cook quicker, and won’t be stone cold inside the center. Ingredients needed in order to smoke a perfect steak couldn’t be simpler, so grab a steak next occasion you’re on the market, and purchase to a delicious meal.</p>

            </div>
            <div><strong>Direction</strong>
                <p>Use a generous number of salt and pepper to season the steak, and gently press it into your meat along with your fingers. The thicker the cut of steak, the greater salt and pepper you should have.</p>
                
                <p>Use a whopping pan in order to smoke steak. Cast iron pans perform most optimally for this particular meal. Get the pan nice and hot, you can add the oil. Wait for the oil to heat, it needs to just commence to smoke before adding the steak. Add the steak and push it down inside center with the fingers to be sure the entire steak is touching the bottom from the pan.</p>

                <strong>Tips</strong>
                <p>1.Choose a heavy-duty frying pan with a thick base and, ideally, a non-stick coating. Don’t overcrowd the pan – cook the steaks one or two at a time, then heat them through in the sauce later.</p>
                <p>2.Use your fingers to prod the meat. When rare, it will feel soft; medium-rare should be only lightly bouncy; well done will feel much firmer.</p>
                <p>3.Don’t season a steak until just before cooking, as salt draws out moisture from meat. Gordon sprinkles sea salt and freshly ground black pepper onto a dinner plate and presses the steaks into the seasoning just before cooking them.</p>
